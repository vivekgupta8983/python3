# Why Python?

Python has a wide range of libraries for open-source data analysis tools, web frameworks, testing, and so on. Python is a programming language that can be used on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, and embedded Linux H/W platforms, such as Raspberry Pi). It's used to develop desktop as well as web applications.
Developers can write programs with fewer lines if they use Python. Prototyping is very quick, as Python runs on an interpreter system. Python can be treated in an object-oriented, procedural, or functional way.
Python can do various tasks, such as creating web applications. It is used with the software to create workflows; it connects to database systems, handles files, handles big data, and performs complex mathematics.

The code written in Python is highly readable because it's similar to the English language. To complete a command, Python uses new lines.
Python has a great feature: indentation. Using indentations, we can define the scope for decision-making statements, loops such as for and while loops, functions, and classes.

## Python vs Bash

Python is a scripting language, whereas Bash is a shell used for entering and executing commands
Dealing with larger programs is easier with Python
In Python, you can do most things just by calling a one-line function from imported modules

# Variables

there's no need to declare your variables first. In Python, just think of any name to give your variable and assign it a value. You can use that variable in your program. So, in Python, you can declare variables whenever you need them.

# String

# Data Types

Lists are enclosed in square brackets [ ] and they are mutable.

Tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ) and they are immutable. 

A dictionary is a data type in Python, which consists of key-value pairs and is enclosed in curly braces { }. Dictionaries are unordered and indexed by keys, where each key must be unique. These keys must be immutable type. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples.
